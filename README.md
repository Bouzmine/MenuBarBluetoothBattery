# MenuBarBluetoothBattery (Mac Only)
#### The code is really bad, I only worked on this until it worked, so some hacky things are to be seen here. Not tested more than "It works on my computer".
A small Electron app which checks the battery level of your Magic Apple accessories. I created it because I wanted a quick way to glance at my battery levels. It might work with any accessory which provide Bluetooth battery reporting but this was only tested with Apple Magic Keyboard and Trackpad. The hotkey is `Shift+Ctrl+Cmd+D`.
